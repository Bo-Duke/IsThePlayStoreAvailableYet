Since I don't own a Chromebook anymore, I may not finish this app. If you really need something like it, try [Ryann Johnson's](https://ryannjohnson.com/) awesome ["Tell Me When My Chromebook Gets Play Store" app](https://tellmewhenmychromebookgetsplay.store/), there's even email notifications!

# IsThePlayStoreAvailableYet
Simple web app that tells you if the Play Store is available on your Chromebook
